In June 2018, I have attended the [VTC2018-Spring](http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtc2018spring/) conference held in Porto, Portugal. In the conference, I have presented two papers in the areas of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive radio (CR) which fall under next-generation wireless technologies. After returning to IIIT, I have given my views on 5G to institute digital magazine. You can find the article [here](http://blogs.iiit.ac.in/5g-technology/).
