Starting from MATLAB R2021b version, comm.LDPCEncoder system object used for LDPC coding is not recommended. The recommended function is ldpcEncode(), which takes in two-three arguments: the first argument is a vector or a matrix. The second argument is the configuration object, which depends on the parity check matrix in use. For details on the third argument, referÂ [here](https://se.mathworks.com/help/comm/ref/ldpcencode.html).

For all those who want to use the function with a specific code rate, I have created a helper function called generateConfigLDPC(), which inputs the rate and outputs the configuration object, which can be directly given to ldpcEncode() function. This avoids the hassle of getting searching/providing manually the parity check matrix and properly creating configuration objects.

The rates supported by the function created are as per IEEE 802.11 standard, which supports: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and 5/6. Similarly, currently supported codeword block lengths: 648, 1296, and 1944. The default codeword length is 648 unless otherwise specified, and the "standard" argument can be left empty as currently, only the WLAN standard is supported.

When I get some time in the future, I can include WiMAX and 5G NR standard parity matrices.

Following syntaxes are supported:

```
% Example 1:
rate = 1/2;
[cfgLDPCEnc,decodercfg] = generateConfigLDPC(rate,'decoderAlgo','bp');

% Example 2:
rate = 1/2;
n = 1944;
[cfgLDPCEnc,decodercfg] = generateConfigLDPC(rate,n,'decoderAlgo','norm-min-sum');

% Example 3:
rate = 1/2;
n = 1944;
[cfgLDPCEnc,decodercfg] = generateConfigLDPC(rate,n,'decoderAlgo','norm-min-sum','standard','wlan');

% Example 4
rate = 3/4; % code rate
n = 1296; % Codeword length
decodAlgo = 'offset-min-sum'; % LDPC decoding algorithm
[cfgLDPCEnc,decodercfg] = generateConfigLDPC(rate,n,'decoderAlgo',decodAlgo,'standard','wlan');
```
