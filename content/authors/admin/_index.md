I am a [Ph.D. student](https://liu.se/en/employee/zaksh81) in the Communications Systems Division, Electrical Engineering Dept, Linköping University (LiU), Sweden. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Erik G. Larsson](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=79Lry6oAAAAJ&hl=sv&oi=ao) and [](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=Maij4akAAAAJ&hl=en)[Prof. Emil Björnson](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=Maij4akAAAAJ&hl=en). My research work is focused on developing signal processing algorithms for cell-free massive MIMO networks which is envisaged to be a potential next generation technology beyond 5G.
