I am a [PhD student](https://liu.se/en/employee/zaksh81) in Communications Systems Division, Electrical Engineering Dept, Linkoping University (LiU), Sweden. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Erik G. Larsson](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=79Lry6oAAAAJ&hl=sv&oi=ao) and [Prof. Emil Bjornson](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=Maij4akAAAAJ&hl=en). I am working on signal processing algorithms for cell-free massive MIMO networks which is envisaged to be a potential technology beyond 5G.
