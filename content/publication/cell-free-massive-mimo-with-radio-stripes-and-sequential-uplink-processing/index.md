abstract: Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) is envisaged to be a next-generation
  technology beyond 5G with its high spectral efficiency and superior spatial
  diversity as compared to that of conventional MIMO technology. The main
  principle is that many distributed access points (APs) cooperate to
  simultaneously serve all the users within the network without creating cell
  boundaries. This paper considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system
  utilizing the radio stripe network architecture. We propose a novel sequential
  processing algorithm with normalized linear minimum mean square error
  (N-LMMSE) combining at every AP. This algorithm enables interference
  suppression in cell-free mMIMO while keeping the cost and front-haul
  requirements low. The spectral efficiency of the proposed algorithm is
  computed and analyzed. We conclude that it provides an attractive trade-off
  between low front-haul requirements and high spectral efficiency.
