abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) is an
  emerging technology for beyond 5G with its promising features such as higher
  spectral efficiency and superior spatial diversity as compared to conventional
  multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. The main working principle
  of cell-free mMIMO is that many distributed access points (APs) cooperate
  simultaneously to serve all the users within the network without creating cell
  boundaries. This paper considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system
  utilizing the radio stripe network architecture with a sequential fronthaul
  between the APs. A novel uplink sequential processing algorithm is developed,
  which is proved to be optimal in both the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) and
  the minimum mean square error (MSE) sense. A detailed quantitative analysis of
  the fronthaul requirement or signaling of the proposed algorithm and its
  comparison with competing sub-optimal algorithms is provided. Key conclusions
  and implications are summarized in the form of corollaries. Based on the
  analytical and numerical simulation results, we conclude that the proposed
  scheme can significantly reduce the fronthaul signaling, without compromising
  the communication performance.
